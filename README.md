✨ Features

- **🧹 Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and converts numeric fields
- **⚙️ Feature Engineering**: Extracts area information and identifies commercial properties
- **🤖 Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Regressor for price prediction
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Includes input validation with suggestions for similar city/area names
- **📊 Visualization**: Provides insightful plots of price distributions and feature importance
- **💻 Interactive CLI**: Allows users to compare their expected price with model predictions

📂 Dataset
The model uses the [House Price Bangladesh](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/durjoychandrapaul/house-price-bangladesh) dataset from Kaggle with the following features:

- 💰 `Price_in_taka` - Property price in Bangladeshi Taka (৳)
- 🛏️ `Bedrooms` - Number of bedrooms
- 🚿 `Bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms
- 🏢 `Floor_no` - Floor number
- 📏 `Floor_area` - Area in square feet
- � `City` - City location (Dhaka, Chittagong, etc.)
- 📍 `Location` - Detailed address
- 🏷️ `Title` - Property title/description
- 🚪 `Occupancy_status` - (New, Used, Under Construction)

🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction-bd.git](https://github.com/Souad-Hasan/House-Price-Prediction-in-Bangladesh-)
   cd house-price-prediction-bd
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 🚀 Usage

Run the script directly:
```bash
python house_price_predictor.py
```

The program will:
1. 📥 Load and preprocess the data
2. 🏋️ Train the machine learning model
3. 📈 Show model performance metrics
4. 📊 Display visualizations
5. 💬 Enter an interactive CLI for price comparisons

 📊 Model Performance

The model provides two key metrics:
- **📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Shows the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices
- **📈 R-squared Score**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in prices

 💡 Example CLI Interaction

```
🔢 Enter property details to compare your price with the model prediction.

💰 Expected Price (in Taka): 50,00,000
🛏️ Number of Bedrooms: 3
🚿 Number of Bathrooms: 2
🏢 Floor Number: 5
📏 Floor Area (sq ft): 1200
🏙️ City (e.g., dhaka): dhaka
📍 Area (e.g., Dhanmondi): Dhanmondi
🏪 Is Commercial Property? (0 for No, 1 for Yes): 0

📊 Model Predicted Price: ৳4,850,000.00
💰 Your Provided Price: ৳5,000,000.00
⚠️ Overpriced by ৳150,000.00 (3.09%)
```
